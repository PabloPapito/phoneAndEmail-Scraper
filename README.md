# phoneAndEmail-Scraper
This is a great simple program. It extracts phone numbers and emails.

This program can easily give you phone numbers (US) and emails from any file, website or wherever you can copy such data. It's pretty magical.
How does it work?
You just copy your data, run this program and paste it into e.g. Excel or Notepad.
Easy? Easy. :)

Enjoy.

This feature, which extracts phone numbers from the US standard, can be easily adjust to other patterns/regions.
